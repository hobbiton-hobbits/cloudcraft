CloudCraft is a real-time chat and task manager application designed for organizations.

## User list
The user list contains a list of users the logged-in user can chat with. The user currently being chatted with, if any, is highlighted.

## Group list
The group list contains a list of groups the logged-in user is a member of and can chat with. The group currently being chatted with, if any, is highlighted.

## Current chat
The chat with the currently-selected user is displayed in the main pane. It displays the other user's chats on the left side in bubbles. It displays the logged-in user's chats on the right side in bubbles. All messages are sorted in chronological order, with the latest messages at the bottom. A user can delete their message if the message is not associated with a task. A user can also edit their message. The chat box allows the currently logged-in user to type a message.

## Task list
The task list displays all the tasks for the current user. Tasks can be associated with a message, or not. Tasks can be checked off to indicate completion.
