# CloudCraft
CloudCraft is a real-time chat and task manager application designed for organizations.

Created by Alex Lee, Brian Vose, Casey Penk, Christopher Garcia, Daniel Shin, James Anderson, and Yong Tang in September and October 2022.

## User list
The user list contains a list of users the logged-in user can chat with. The user currently being chatted with, if any, is highlighted.

## Group list
The group list contains a list of groups the logged-in user is a member of and can chat with. The group currently being chatted with, if any, is highlighted.

## Current chat
The chat with the currently-selected user is displayed in the main pane. It displays the other user's chats on the left side in bubbles. It displays the logged-in user's chats on the right side in bubbles. All messages are sorted in chronological order, with the latest messages at the bottom. A user can delete their message if the message is not associated with a task. A user can also edit their message. The chat box allows the currently logged-in user to type a message.

## Task list
The task list displays all the tasks for the current user. Tasks can be associated with a message, or not. Tasks can be checked off to indicate completion.
